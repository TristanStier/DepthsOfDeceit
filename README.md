Basically Underwater Among Us

MinigameScene.unitypackage is the package for the minigame to add to the main game

Known bugs:
  - Dashing (but not moving) diagonally is faster than straight up or down
  - Trail emitter is very much off center from the character sprite, idk how to move it

How to add:
  - The minigame people will add it once the main game is on the github
  - Assets->Import Package->Custom Package
  - File->Build Settings->Add Open Scene (open the scene and then click the button)
  - Upload it back onto github
